# Overview
Given Likelihood is a likelihood wheel picker. It is an interactive web application designed to visually represent probabilities in a fun and engaging way. It spins to randomly select one of four likelihoods: Unlikely, Likely, Most Likely, and Highly Likely. This tool can be used for decision making, risk assessment simulations, educational purposes, or simply as a fun game to play with friends and family.

# Features
Interactive Wheel: Click the wheel to make it spin. The wheel gradually slows down and stops to randomly point at one of the likelihoods.
Color-Coded Segments: Each segment of the wheel is color-coded (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue) corresponding to the likelihood it represents.
Static Arrow Indicator: A fixed arrow at the bottom of the wheel indicates the result when the wheel stops spinning.

# Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the web application.
CSS: For styling the interface, including the spinning animation and layout.
JavaScript: For implementing interactive elements and the spinning logic of the wheel.
